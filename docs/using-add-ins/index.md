# Add-Ins Overview

Add-ins have been developed to allow users to easily interface with Q-Action while viewing documents and emails in other applications.  The primary function of these add-ins is to allow users to add documents directly to Q-Action from within another application.

There are currently three add-ins available for interfacing with Q-Action:

- [Office Add-In](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Using_the_Office_and_Acrobat_Add-Ins.htm) - for use with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook
- [Acrobat Add-In](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Using_the_Office_and_Acrobat_Add-Ins.htm) - for use with Adobe Acrobat
- [Chrome Extension](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Adding_an_Email_with_Chrome_Extension.htm) - for use with Gmail in Google Chrome
