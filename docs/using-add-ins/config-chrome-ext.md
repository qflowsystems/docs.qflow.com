# Configuring the Email Chrome Extension

The Chrome Extension allows users to configure the URL for the Q-Action application.  This allows for users to change the URL, usually for testing purposes, without having to install a whole different version of the extension.  However this requires that the user does configure the URL before the extension can be used.  

If a URL has not been configured when the user goes to add an email to Q-Action, the following error message will be displayed:

Please configure Q-Action url in extension options.

Follow the steps below to configure the URL.

1. Click on the Customize icon (![](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//assets/images/images/Gmail%20Extension/customize-icon.png)), then select More Tools > Extensions.
