# Configuring the Email Chrome Extension

The Chrome Extension allows users to configure the URL for the QAction application.  This allows for users to change the URL, usually for testing purposes, without having to install a whole different version of the extension.  However this requires that the user does configure the URL before the extension can be used.  

If a URL has not been configured when the user goes to add an email to QAction, the following error message will be displayed:

Please configure QAction url in extension options.

Follow the steps below to configure the URL.

1. Click on the Customize icon (![](/assets/images/customize-icon.png)), then select More Tools > Extensions.  
    ![](/assets/images/more-tools-extensions.png)
    
2. Locate the QAction GMail Extension and click Details.  
    ![](/assets/images/extension-details.png)

3. Scroll down to find and click on Extension Options.  
    ![](/assets/images/extension-options.png)
    
4. Enter the /services/ URL for the environment you wish to add emails to and click Save.
