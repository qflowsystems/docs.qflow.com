# Configuring the Email Chrome Extension

The Chrome Extension allows users to configure the URL for the Q-Action application.  This allows for users to change the URL, usually for testing purposes, without having to install a whole different version of the extension.  However this requires that the user does configure the URL before the extension can be used.  

If a URL has not been configured when the user goes to add an email to Q-Action, the following error message will be displayed:

Please configure Q-Action url in extension options.

Follow the steps below to configure the URL.

1. Click on the Customize icon (![](/assets/images/customize-icon.png)), then select More Tools > Extensions.  
    ![](/assets/images/more-tools-extensions.png)
    
2. Locate the QAction GMail Extension and click Details.  
    ![](/assets/images/extension-details.png)

3. Scroll down to find and click on Extension Options.  
    ![](/assets/images/extension-options.png)
    
4. Enter the /services/ URL for the environment you wish to add emails to and click Save.
