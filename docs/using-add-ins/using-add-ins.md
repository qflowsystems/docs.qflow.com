# Using the Office and Acrobat Add-Ins

With the QAction Office Add-In, you can add documents to QAction using Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Outlook.  In an Office application with the Office Add-In installed, you can find the add-in menu by clicking on the Q icon in the Home ribbon.

With the QAction Acrobat Add-In, you can add documents to QAction using Adobe Acrobat. In Acrobat with the Add-In installed, you can find the add-in menu by clicking File > QAction Menus.

These two add-ins function very similarly to each other, so they are both covered together in this topic.  With the Acrobat Add-In, there is more to consider around PDF security, which you can read about [here](/docs/using-add-ins/pdf-security).

## Add a New Document
Most of the time, the only option available in the add-in menu is Add to QAction.

When you click Add to QAction, an internet browser window opens taking you to QAction.  You will be prompted to log in if you aren't already logged in.  
  
If you are using Outlook, you will be taken to the [Email Upload Wizard](/docs/using-add-ins/email-upload-wizard) next, which is discussed in further detail in its own topic.  
  
Once you have logged in and completed the Email Upload Wizard if applicable, the [Upload Documents](/docs/working-with-documents/add-documents/upload-documents) window appears, where you can finish adding the document to QAction.

## Check In or Cancel Check Out

Different options appear when you are viewing a document that you have checked out from QAction.

The first two options both add the document that you're viewing to QAction as a new version of the document you checked out.  

Check In To QAction allows other users to modify the document after you check it in.  Once this is completed, the document will close.

Check In (Keep Checked Out) keeps the document checked out so that other users still can't modify it.  The document will remain open once this is completed.

Cancel Check Out simply cancels the check out in QAction without adding anything to QAction.  Once this is completed, the document will close.
