# Document Workflows

The system can be configured to automatically launch a Workflow when certain documents are added to the system.  Workflows can be customized for different documents, document types, classifications, or departments.

When a user [adds and indexes a document](/docs/working-with-documents/add-documents/upload-documents) that is configured to launch a Workflow, then the system assigns a Route Document Task to the appropriate user or group.

The designated user or group then finds the Route Document Task in their Inbox and opens it to view the Route Document window.

Add Document to New [Workflow Folder] creates a new Folder as indicated at the top of the screen, and adds the document to it.  The first Task in the Folder's Workflow is then assigned to the appropriate user or group.

If a new Folder should not be created after all, the user can select No Workflow, Add To Repository Only to skip creating a Folder and simply finish adding the Document to the system.  This option may not be available if the document must be added to a Folder.

Regardless of which the user selects, you can view the Route Document Task you just completed on the Recently Completed Tab on the Inbox screen, and the Document can be searched for on the Search Documents screen.

Other actions the user can take on this screen include:
- Re-Index - takes the user to the Indexing screen where they can change the Document's index fields.
- Delete - deletes the document from the system.
- Put Back - closes the Route Document window and allows other relevant users to decide what to do with this document.
- Re-Route - sends the Route Document Task to another user or organization.
