# Workflow Management Introduction

Workflows allow your organization to track business process information alongside documents and other content within QAction.

There are three main concepts that are important to understand:

- A Task is a single action assigned to a user or group of users.
- A Workflow is a collection of Tasks, which defines which Tasks get assigned in what order.
- A Folder is a collection of data and documents related to a given Workflow.  When a Workflow is launched, the system creates a Folder to tie the Workflow together with relevant documents and other data.  

Each user has an Inbox, which contains tasks that the user must complete. When a task is assigned to a group or position, it appears in the Inboxes of all users in that group or position. An administrator can assign a group or position task to a specific user.  Users can also search for Workflows or Folders using the relevant Tabs in the left-hand menu.  Read more about the Inbox, Workflows, and Folders Tabs [here](/docs/workflows-and-tasks/workflow-screens).

An administrator can set up a standard Workflow for a business process or allow an assignee to apply the correct Workflow on a Folder-by-Folder basis. When authorized, the Workflow for a specific Folder can be modified after it starts.

The system can automatically launch a Workflow when a specific document type is stored. Authorized users can also launch Workflows on the fly.
