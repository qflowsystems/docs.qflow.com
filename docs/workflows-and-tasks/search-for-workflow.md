# Search for a Folder or Workflow

These tutorials assume that you have a basic understanding of how Searches work.  See [Performing a Search](/docs/performing-searches/performing-a-search.html) and other topics in the Performing Searches section for more detailed guides to Searching in Q-Action.

## Folder
Follow the steps below to perform an example Folder search.

1. In the left navigation pane, click Folders.  
    The Search Folders screen appears.
2. Click the Folder Type drop-down list, and select a folder type.
3. Add the Folder Status search filter from the Common Folder Fields section of the Search Options drop-down menu.
4. Open the Folder Status drop-down to select a status to search for.

    Note that the Folder Status field is the status of the entire Folder/Workflow.  This is in contrast with the Status field for a Task, used in the Workflow tutorial below, which is the status of a single Task in the Workflow.
5. Click Search.

    The Search Workflows screen appears.
2. In the Task Name field, start typing to view suggestions and select the desired name.

    Note that the Status field is the status of a specific Task that you are looking for.  This is in contrast with the Folder Status field, used in the previous tutorial, which is the status of the entire Folder/Workflow.
5. Click Search.  
    The Workflows appear with the indicated task name and status.
