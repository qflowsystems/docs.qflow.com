# Search for a Folder or Workflow

These tutorials assume that you have a basic understanding of how Searches work.  See [Performing a Search](/docs/performing-searches/performing-a-search) and other topics in the Performing Searches section for more detailed guides to Searching in Q-Action.

## Folder
Follow the steps below to perform an example Folder search.

1. In the left navigation pane, click Folders.  
    The Search Folders screen appears.
2. Click the Folder Type drop-down list, and select a folder type.
3. Add the Folder Status search filter from the Common Folder Fields section of the Search Options drop-down menu.
4. Open the Folder Status drop-down to select a status to search for.

    Note that the Folder Status field is the status of the entire Folder/Workflow.  This is in contrast with the Status field for a Task, used in the Workflow tutorial below, which is the status of a single Task in the Workflow.
5. Click Search.

    Note that the Status field is the status of a specific Task that you are looking for.  This is in contrast with the Folder Status field, used in the previous tutorial, which is the status of the entire Folder/Workflow.
5. Click Search.  
    The Workflows appear with the indicated task name and status.
