## Configuring User Preferences

Access your user profile to configure your user preferences.

1. Locate and click your username on the top-right of any QAction screen, and click Profile.  
    * The User Profile window appears.  
    ![User Profile Window - Preferences](/assets/images/preferences.png "User Profile Window - Preferences")

    * Access your user profile to configure your user preferences.

1. Locate and click your username on the top-right of any QAction screen, and click Profile.  
    * The User Profile window appears.  
    ![User Profile Window - Preferences](/assets/images/preferences.png "User Profile Window - Preferences")
    
2. Review the options available on the Preference tab:
    - **Open Admin Links in Popups checkbox** - When selected, this setting turns all of the Administration screens into pop-out windows. Therefore, if a menu is opened from the Administration menu (only viewable for admins), it does not open within the screen. Instead a separate window opens.
    - **Show Column Results View checkbox** - When selected, all of the results on your search pages (Inbox, Search Documents, etc.) appear in the Grid view by default instead of the List view.
    - **Hide Office Check In Verification checkbox** - When selected, the verification page that appears when you are using Microsoft Office Add-Ins to check in documents on a new or unrecognized PC is hidden. The verification page appears to ensure the document is being checked in by the appropriate user.
    - **Hide menus after popout checkbox** - When selected, the left navigation pane is hidden when the New Browser (![](/assets/images/new-browser-button.PNG)) shortcut is used. If a task or other popout window appears, and the user clicks the New Browser (![](/assets/images/new-browser-button.PNG)) button in the corner, then the window opens on a new screen without the left navigation pane. If the checkbox is cleared, the navigation pane appears when the window expands.
    - **Preview PDFs by Default checkbox** - when selected, clicking on a PDF opens a preview of it in the application.  If this is turned off, PDFs will be downloaded instead just like other documents.
    - **Preview Task Initiating Document** checkbox - when selected, folders that launch initiating documents when viewing a task will display the initiating document in the browser instead of downloading it, if it is a PDF.  Otherwise, the initiating document will be downloaded.
    - **Preview PDFs In*** drop-down list - In this required field, choose whether to preview PDFs in an **Internal Popup** that can be moved around within the app to allow for viewing other data at the same time, or **Full Window** which focuses the PDF front and center for optimal viewing.
    - **Work tasks in* drop-down list** - In this required field, choose between Internal Popup, Full Window, or New Tab/Window, so that when a task is opened, it opens in an internal popup that overlays the main application screen, opens to replace the main application screen, or opens in a new browser window.
    - **Notify me of new tasks via email drop-down list** - In this required field, choose to be alerted when you receive a new task Daily, Immediately, or Never.
    - **Notify me of overdue tasks via email drop-down list** - In this required field, choose to be alerted when a task is overdue the 1st Day, the 1st Day and all following days, or Never.
    - **Pick default start page* drop-down list** - In this required field, choose any of the application search screens to be the first page you see when you log in (ex. Inbox, Documents, Index Queue, Person).
    - **Pick default classification drop-down list** - if selected, the system will automatically select this classification whenever you begin indexing a document. You can always change the classification on individual documents during indexing.
3. Under Preferences, clear or select the checkboxes as needed, and then select the preferred settings for each drop-down list.
    
4. Click Apply Changes.

## Configuring User Proxies
Access your user profile to configure your preferences and proxies.

A proxy is a user who can log in as you to perform certain maintenance actions, for instance if you are on vacation. When one user chooses to proxy as another user, the proxy user’s workspace appears. This means:

- Any [Saved Searches](/docs/performing-searches/saved-search/) associated with the proxy user appear in the left navigation pane accordingly. The Organize button is unavailable because one user cannot make changes to another user’s navigation pane. Users cannot modify proxy user searches.
- Any documents that were in the proxy user's Upload queue appear on the [Upload Documents](/docs/working-with-documents/add-documents/upload-documents) screen.  Documents on this screen can be added to the system or removed from the queue, but no new documents may be added to the queue.

Follow the steps below to setup another user's ability to proxy for you.
1. Locate and click your username on the top-right of any QAction screen, and click Profile.  
    - The User Profile window appears.
    
2. Click Proxies, and then click Add.  
    - The Add/Modify Proxy window appears.  
    ![User Profile Window - Proxies Tab to Add/Modify Proxy Window](/assets/images/profile-proxy-window.PNG "User Profile Window - Proxies Tab to Add/Modify Proxy Window")

3. For the User, Start Date, and End Date fields, enter your information, and then click Save.

4. Click Apply Changes.

Once this is set up, the Proxy user can view your workspace by following the steps below.
1. In the top-right, click the username menu (ex. Doe, John).
2. Click Login for [User, Name] (ex. Login for Doe, Jane).  
    Your proxy changes and you can view Jane Doe's workspace.

## User Deactivation
This is an optional feature which may or may not be enabled in your environment.

If this feature is enabled, then administrators have set a certain number of days after which users are automatically deactivated if they have not logged into the system.

As a user in this case, the system will send you two reminder e-mails before your account is deactivated, and a final e-mail to inform you if your account has been deactivated.

If you never receive such e-mails, then either you are logging in frequently enough that the system never flags you as in danger of becoming inactive, or this feature has not been enabled in your environment.  Contact your system administrator if you have any questions.
