# Document Management Introduction
---
Q-Action is an out-of-the-box Enterprise Content Management (ECM) application package. With Q-Action, your organization can store and organize all of its paper documents, electronic files, and emails in a single, integrated repository. The system uses security policies to protect documents from unauthorized access.

To learn about the workflow capabilities of the application, refer to the [Workflow Functionality](/docs/workflows-and-tasks/) content.

This section discusses all document capabilities available in Q-Action (ex. adding, editing, and searching for documents).  There are also add-ins available for other applications to interface with Q-Action, which you can read more about [here](/docs/using-add-ins/).

This electronic storage solution is beneficial for the following reasons:

*   It reduces the need for file cabinets and associated floor space.
*   It provides quick access to documents using an intuitive, web-based, online search.
*   It provides a means to back up files, so company records are not at risk in the event of a disaster.
*   It is suitable for small to large organizations.
*   Because the application is web-based, users can access documents from distributed locations.  

The following are some of Q-Action's capabilities:

*   Store electronic document
*   Check out/in documents for version control
*   Capture email messages and attachments
*   Scan documents and review the quality
*   Index documents with barcode functionality and field entry
*   Generate PDFs using Optical Character Recognition
*   Use index data to search and retrieve content
*   View, print, and export documents
*   Develop user and organization roles
*   Restrict certain user abilities and allow for certain users to have administrative abilities
*   Extract and analyze document data
*   Capture emails and documents in batches

These features can all be customized according to your company's needs.
