# Add Documents to Checklists
---
Checklists are an easy way to determine which document types are uploaded for a particular project or to determine which document types are still needed.

You can find checklists saved alongside [Saved Searches](Saved_Searches_Overview.htm) in the left-hand menu.  You can learn more about creating checklists [here](Checklist_Saved_Searches.htm).

When you open a checklist, likely you will need to update the search criteria.  We will be looking at an example onboarding checklist, which lists documents needed for onboarding a new employee.  In this example, the user will need to update the exact employee they want to add a document for.

Once you have updated the search criteria on the checklist, click Search.  Then you will see the list of Document Types in the checklist.

## Example Onboarding Checklist

This will cause a \* to appear at the top of the screen.  That simply lets you know that there are unsaved changes to the checklist that you opened - in our example, it means that you entered an employee into the blank employee field.  If you want, you can [save this as a new checklist](Checklist_Saved_Searches.htm), and the \* will go away.  Otherwise, don't worry about it.

In the example above, this employee already has an Employment Application document added to the system, but does not have a Contract, Resume, or Terms and Conditions.

You can hide the documents that are already in the system by clicking the Show All toggle to OFF.  This can be useful for only looking at the Document Types that still need to be added to the checklist.

## Example Onboarding Checklist - Only Missing Items

To add a new document to the checklist, you can either click Browse or drag and drop the document onto the Document Type you want to add it to.

Either way, the Document Indexing Window will open to allow you to modify index fields before finalizing the document upload.

Note that if you change any key index fields - Employee, in our example - then the document will not be added to the checklist you are viewing, though it will still be added to the system.

When you are done, click Save.  A progress bar will appear to indicate that the document is being added to the system.  Meanwhile, if you like, you can upload another document.

## Adding New Version of Existing Document while Previous Document Uploads

See [Handling Add Document Errors](Add_Document_Errors.htm) for what to do in the event that adding a document is unsuccessful.

If you drag and drop a document over an existing document in the checklist, the system will ask you whether you want to add the document you dragged as a new document or a new version of the document already in the checklist.
