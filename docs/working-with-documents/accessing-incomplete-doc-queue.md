# Access Notifications

The Notification (![Notifications Icon](/assets/images/notification-icon.PNG "Notifications Icon")) button appears for these reasons:
- A document is added to the Upload Documents window, but the indexing is not complete.
- A document is added to the Upload Documents window and then Batch and Split Document is selected, but the Batch Assembly tasks are not complete.
- A folder is printed, and the exported PDF or Excel content has not been viewed. (From the left navigation pane, click Folders, search for a folder, and then click the Actions menu > Print Folder.)
- A search result list is exported as a PDF or Excel sheet and has not been viewed.
- A new user guide is released and has not been viewed.
- An encrypted e-mail has been added to the system.

If the Upload Documents window is closed before all the documents are uploaded or indexed and a user chooses to enter index information later, you can access the uploaded documents later.
