# Make Documents Read-Only
---
If a document is read-only, then it cannot be checked out or edited. If the **Read-Only** option is applied to a document, there is no **Check Out** option available from the Action menu of the document. When a document is marked as read-only, it cannot be undone.

1. In the left navigation pane, click Documents, and perform a search to locate a document.
    
2. Click the Actions menu next to the document title.
    
3. Click **Make Read-Only**. A message appears stating: \
`Are you sure you want to make this document read-only?`

4. Click **OK** to apply the read-only setting to the document. The **Lock** icon (![](/assets/images/lock-icon.png)) appears next to the document title indicating it is read-only.
