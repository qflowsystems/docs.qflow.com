# Accessing the Document Actions Menu
On the Search Documents screen, document maintenance actions can be accessed by selecting a document and opening the Actions drop-down menu above the list of documents on the screen.  Multiple documents may be selected at once, but this will narrow down the maintenance actions available in the Actions menu. 

The screen example below shows the Actions when multiple documents are selected from the Search Results.

On the Search Documents screen, document maintenance actions can also be accessed in the Actions drop-down menu on each individual document search result.

Actions for a Single Document in Search Results

Only users with appropriate permissions can see the document maintenance actions in the Actions drop-down menus.
