# Modifying Document Security Settings
With the correct permissions, you can modify the security on a particular document so that only certain users or positions can view, add, check in/out, or delete documents;  modify indexes; or modify the security settings on the document.

{: .note}
Any security changes you make for a specific document takes precedence over the security settings configured for the document classification. Only make changes if the security of a particular document differs in some way from the settings already configured for the document classification.

1. In the left navigation pane, click **Documents**, and perform a search to locate a document.
    
2. Click the **Actions** menu next to the document title.
    
3. Click **Modify Security**. The _Modify Document Security_ window appears.

4. Select or clear the permissions for user roles to remove or add capabilities, and click **Save**.

5. To revert the security settings to what they were before you changed them, click **Restore Defaults**.  The security settings are reverted to the security settings used for that particular document classification.
