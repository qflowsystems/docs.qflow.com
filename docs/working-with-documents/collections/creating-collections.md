# Creating Collections

To organize your content, use collections to group together documents that have different classifications, departments, organizations, or users.

1. In the left navigation pane, click Collections.  
    The Search Collections screen appears.

3. In the Classification field, enter or select a temporary placeholder classification that has a Collections icon (![](/assets/images/collection-icon.PNG))  next to it.  
    Based on the classification selected, the subsequent fields adjust to show the configured fields for that classification.
4. Once the classification is chosen and the index fields reflect your selection, enter information in the remaining fields.
5. Click Save.  
    In the Search Collections window, the collection appears with the name you chose. Documents can be added to this collection.
