# Document Collections
---
In Q-Action, each document has a special index field called Collection. A collection links documents together that are related to one another. With collections, users can easily find all documents related for a specific event or purpose. A document can be linked to multiple collections. Like documents, each collection is associated with a classification.

Document collections allow multiple related documents to be viewed together. They also allow the documents to have their security managed as a group.

Some collections are created up front and assigned to documents as they are stored (ex. claim documents, board meeting materials, project documentation). Other collections can be created and then linked to documents that have already been stored (ex. Audits, FOIA Requests, Sunshine Requests).

Examples of collection names include the following:
- 2016 IRS Tax Audit
- 2017 2nd Quarter Board Meeting
- 2018 HR Conference
- David Roberts Workers Compensation Claim Case

Each of these collections would have multiple documents added. For these situations, a user creates a collection and then associates the collection with each document as it is added.

The system includes a collection search screen. Users can find all documents related to a collection by selecting the collection name and performing a search.
