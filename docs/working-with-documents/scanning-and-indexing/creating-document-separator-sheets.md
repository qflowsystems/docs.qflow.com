# Creating Document Separator Cover Sheets

If the document separator sheet (which includes a barcode for index field metadata) is inserted in front of a document, and it is scanned into the system, then there are no more actions to take. The document is indexed and added to the system.

1. Within the application, click the Scanning menu at the top-right.  
    ![Scanning Menu](/assets/images/q-action-scanning-menu.PNG "Scanning Menu")
2. Click Create Document Cover Sheet.  
    The Create Document Cover Sheet screen appears.  
    ![Create Document Cover Sheet Screen](/assets/images/q-action-create-doc-cover-sheet.PNG "Create Document Cover Sheet Screen")
3. Enter information in the necessary fields, and then click Generate.  
    The separatorsheet.pdf generates and downloads.
4. Navigate to your Downloads folder, open the cover sheet, and use it as needed.

To view the document that is scanned into the system, you must have scan operator privileges for the same Source Organization that was selected when the separator sheet was created or when a batch document was created from the Index Queue.
