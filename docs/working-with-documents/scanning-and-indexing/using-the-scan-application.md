# Using the Q-Action Scan Application

Not all users have access to this software. This software works with Q-Action to complete the scanning process.

1. On your desktop, locate and double-click the Q-Action Scan icon.  
    * ![](/assets/images/how-t-o-scan-icon.jpg)  
    * The Q-Action Scan Login window appears.  
    ![](/assets/images/how-to-scan-pdf-images_Page_1_Image_0001.jpg)

2. Enter your User Name and Password, and click Login.  
    * The Q-Action Scan Documents screen appears.  
    ![](/assets/images/how-to-scan-pdf-images_Page_1_Image_0002.jpg)

3. Review the various options on the screen:
    * Bar Code Separation Sheets – If the documents are using a barcode cover sheet for auto-indexing, select this option for scanning.
        * Batch Scan and Index – If the documents are using a batch cover sheet for document separation, select this option for scanning.  
            - Organization – Enter your default location.
            - Submitted by – Ensure it defaults to your name as the person scanning.
            - Classification – Enter the department (classification) the documents are being scan to. For example, Risk Finance or Claims.
            - Date Received – If known, enter the date the documents were received. This field defaults to the current date.
            - Back File Batch – If selected, the batch scans as a “Back File” batch and Q-Action workflow tasks are not created. If it is not selected and the selected classification is connected to a workflow, any workflow initiating documents creates a workflow task.
        - Document Break Method – This section determines how document separation occurs for the batch being scanned. The following are the available options:
            - Single Document, No Separators – If scanning a single document for a classification, select this option.
            - Pages Per Document – If scanning documents with a fixed number of pages, select this option.
            - Variable Pages – If using batch cover sheets to scan, select this option.
        - Remember My Settings – If selected, the scan application remembers the currently selected scan settings. The next time you log in to the scan application, the remembered settings automatically populate.
        - Batch Cover Sheet button – This option is normally used if scanning a single document at a time. Index information for the selected classification is created and a barcode cover sheet is printed to automatically index the document when it is scanned.
        - Document Separator button – Click to print a Patch 2 cover sheet.
        - Scan button – Click to scan documents with the selected classification.
        - Exit button – Click to exit the scan application.
