# Index Documents Screen
---
A user with indexing operator privileges can access the **Index Documents** link in the left-hand menu.

The Index Documents screen shows batches that have been scanned or otherwise imported into Q-Action such as through a fax integration.  These batches need to be split into distinct documents as appropriate, and indexed with the proper metadata to be fully added to the system. 

1. In the left navigation pane, click Index Documents.  
    The Index Documents screen appears.

2. Select an organization to **Show Queues For**.
    
3. Click Search to view documents in the Index Documents queue for the selected organization.
    
4. Choose a document from the queue, and click the Actions menu.
    
5. Click Index Batch.  This opens the [Batch Assembly screen](/docs/working-with-documents/add-documents/adding-documents-in-batches), where the batch can be split into its component documents and indexed into the system accordingly.
