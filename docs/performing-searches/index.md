# Search Functionality Overview
---

Q-Action provides robust search functionality that empowers users to find exactly what they are looking for in the system.  Understanding Q-Action's search screens is a cornerstone to making the application work for you.  

Each of the options in the left-hand menu takes you to a Search screen, all of which work in very similar ways.  Even the Inbox is a Search screen with added features.  More detailed information about how the Inbox is different from other Search screens can be found in the [Workflow Functionality section](q-action_topics/Workflow_Tabs.htm).

Below is an overview of the different parts of a Search screen using the Search Documents screen as an example.  Alternatively, each of these parts will also be touched on in [Tutorial: Performing a Search](Tutorial__Performing_a_Search.htm).

## Search Documents Screen

At the top of the screen is the Top Search Bar.  This field searches on specific index fields that an administrator has configured. On the Search Documents screen, the fields the top search bar will use are determined by the selected Classification, so it is recommended that you always select a Classification, even if you select no other filters and just use the top search bar after that. Similarly, on the Folder and Workflow search screens, you should select a Folder Type to refine how the top search bar works. 

To add specific filters to a search, open the **Filters** drop-down to select the desired filter(s) and enter values for each. Any filters that have been added to the search appear below the Top Search Bar. Pictured above is the Classification filter, which always appears on the Search Documents screen by default. Filters narrow down the search to items with the given value on that specific index field.

When you are ready to perform the Search and see results, click the Search button.  

To [save the search](Saved_Searches_Overview.htm) for future use, open the Save Options menu.

The Search drop-down menu, opened by clicking the triangle on the side of the Search button, lets you [export](Exporting_Search_Results.htm) the search.

Search results can also be exported after you have performed the search using the Export As buttons.

Users can often add new items on the search screen by clicking the Add New link/icon underneath the search filters.  Some Search screens will not have this option, if the user cannot add items of that type to the system.

Display As and Sort By allow you to customize how search results are displayed.  In particular, Display As toggles between list and grid view.  List view is generally the default, but grid view is highly customizable.  Learn more about grid view here: [Customizing Search Columns](Customizing_Search_Columns.htm). 

The Actions drop-down menu allows you to perform actions on selected search results.  The available actions will vary considerably on different search screens.  Documents typically have the most available actions, which you can read about [here](Document_Actions_Overview.htm).
