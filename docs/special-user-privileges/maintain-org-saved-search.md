# Maintaining Organizational Saved Searches

If you are a Saved Search manager, you can modify or delete Organizational saved searches when [organizing the left-hand menu](/docs/performing-searches/saved-search/organizing-personal-and-org-saved-searches), similarly to how all users can modify or delete Personal saved searches.

Alternatively, you can click the Maintain Saved Searches option at the bottom of the left-hand menu instead of the Organize option.  This opens the Saved Search Maintenance Window.

This lists all Organizational saved searches in the system, even some you may not see in your left-hand menu if you are not in the organization the search was pushed out to.  Here you can use the Name and Organization fields to Click on the search you want to modify or delete, and then click the Maintain button.  This will close the Saved Search Maintenance window, and display only the selected saved search in the left-hand menu.

From here, you can use the drop-down arrow next to the saved search to modify or delete it as normal.
