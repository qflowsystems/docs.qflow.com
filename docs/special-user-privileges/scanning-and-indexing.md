# Overview
With scan and indexing operator privileges, users can view the Index Documents screen and scan documents into the system, respectively.

Review the following related tasks.

- [Create batch cover sheets](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//q-action_um_topics/Creating_Document_Batch_Cover_Sheets.htm) or [document separator sheets](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//q-action_um_topics/Creating_Document_Cover_Sheets.htm) using the correct procedures.
- For document batches, insert Batch Cover Sheets between documents, and then use your [scanning software](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Using_the_Scan_Application.htm) to scan the documents.
- Once all documents are scanned, visit the Index Documents screen to [index the batches](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Index_Documents_Screen.htm).
- If the Document Separator Sheet (which includes a barcode for index field metadata) is inserted in front of a document, and it is scanned into the system, then there are no more actions to take.
The document is indexed and added to the system.
- To view the document that is scanned into the system, you must have scan and indexing operator privileges for the same Source Organization that was selected when the separator sheet was created or when a batch document was created from the Index Documents screen.

# Using the Q-Action Scan Application
Not all users have access to this software. This software works with Q-Action to complete the scanning process.

1. On your desktop, locate and double-click the Q-Action Scan icon.  
![](/assets/images/how-t-o-scan-icon.jpg)  
- The Q-Action Scan Login window appears.  
![](/assets/images/how-to-scan-pdf-images_Page_1_Image_0001.jpg)

2. Enter your User Name and Password, and click Login.  
The Q-Action Scan Documents screen appears.  
![](/assets/images/how-to-scan-pdf-images_Page_1_Image_0002.jpg)

3. Review the various options on the screen:
- **Bar Code Separation Sheets** – If the documents are using a barcode cover sheet for auto-indexing, select this option for scanning.
- **Batch Scan and Index** – If the documents are using a batch cover sheet for document separation, select this option for scanning.
    - **Organization** – Enter your default location.
    - **Submitted by** – Ensure it defaults to your name as the person scanning.
    - **Classification** – Enter the department (classification) the documents are being scan to. For example, Risk Finance or Claims.
    - **Date Received** – If known, enter the date the documents were received. This field defaults to the current date.
    - **Back File Batch** – If selected, the batch scans as a “Back File” batch and Q-Action workflow tasks are not created. If it is not selected and the selected classification is connected to a workflow, any workflow initiating documents creates a workflow task.
- **Document Break Method** – This section determines how document separation occurs for the batch being scanned. The following are the available options:
    - **Single Document, No Separators** – If scanning a single document for a classification, select this option.
    - **Pages Per Document** – If scanning documents with a fixed number of pages, select this option.
    - **Variable Pages** – If using batch cover sheets to scan, select this option.
- **Remember My Settings** – If selected, the scan application remembers the currently selected scan settings. The next time you log in to the scan application, the remembered settings automatically populate.
- **Batch Cover Sheet button** – This option is normally used if scanning a single document at a time. Index information for the selected classification is created and a barcode cover sheet is printed to automatically index the document when it is scanned.
- **Document Separator button** – Click to print a Patch 2 cover sheet.
- **Scan button** – Click to scan documents with the selected classification.
- **Exit button** – Click to exit the scan application.

- **Pages** – The total number of pages for the batch.
        
6. Review the various options you can select:
- **Previous Page (Page UP)/Next Page (Page Down)** – Click to move between pages in the viewer for the current document. Keyboard shortcuts are available.

# Index Documents Screen

A user with indexing operator privileges can access the **Index Documents** link in the left-hand menu.
