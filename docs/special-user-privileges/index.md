# Special User Privileges

Q-Action offers different privileges that can be set up for roles, positions, users, or organizations.

The end-users have the ability to add content to the system, but these special privilege users can manipulate how the information is added to the system.

Each privilege provides different abilities. The following unique user roles must be assigned by an Application Administrators. Review the main differences in responsibilities and privileges:

[Saved Search Managers](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//admin-topics/Configuring_Saved_Search_Manager_Privileges_for_Users.htm)

With this privilege, managers can create, modify, delete, and deliver organizational saved searches.

[Assign Task Managers](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Configuring_Assign_Task_Managers.htm)

With assign task privileges, managers can assign tasks to an organization or user even if they are not part of that organization or originally assigned that task.

If employees go out of town, and no one else can work their tasks, a manager with assign task privileges can go into the application to re-assign tasks.

[Administer Task Managers](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Configuring_Administer_Task_Managers.htm)

With administer task privileges, managers can complete tasks for an organization or user even if they are not part of the organization assigned to the task.

If employees go out of town, and no one else can work their tasks, a manager with administer task privileges can go into the application to re-assign or complete tasks.

[Records Managers](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Configuring_Records_Managers.htm)

With records privileges, users can view the Retention menu.

[Staff Managers](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Configuring_System_Managers.htm)

If you manage several user employees and need to monitor their tasks, you can add your role as Manager for each employee. Then a Staff Inbox tab appears in your Inbox screen where you can view all the pending tasks for your employees. You must be a manager of the user within the same company hierarchy.
