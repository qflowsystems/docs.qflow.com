# Viewing Pending Tasks for Staff Members

If you manage several user employees and need to monitor their tasks, you can have an administrator [add your role as Manager]() for each employee. Then a Staff Inbox tab appears in your Inbox screen where you can view all the pending tasks for your employees. You must be a manager of the user within the same company hierarchy.

1. Once you are logged in with the manager account, click Inbox.
2. On the Inbox screen, click the Staff Inbox tab.

3. In the **Staff Inbox** field, click the drop-down to select a specific employee you manager.  
    In the results, you can see that status of each task, what role or user needs to complete the task, the due date, and more.
4. Click the title of a pending task.  
    The folder window appears with the Active Task tab inaccessible. Managers can only assign or work tasks if they have the correct privileges.
5. Click the Documents tab to view existing documents or add documents to this task.
