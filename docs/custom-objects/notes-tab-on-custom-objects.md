# Notes Tab on Custom Objects
---

The Notes Tab on a Custom Object View Screen displays Notes that have been added to the Custom Object, and allows you to add your own Notes.

As you can see in the screenshot above, a long Note will cut off, and you can view the full text of the Note by clicking the pop-out icon (![](../../assets/images/CustomObjectViewIcon.png)) that appears at the end of the Note on this screen.  Alternatively, you can switch to Grid View and hover over the Note column to see the full text.
