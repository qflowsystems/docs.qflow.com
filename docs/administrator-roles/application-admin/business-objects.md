## Overview
A business object, also called a [custom object,](/docs/custom-objects/) is multiple fields associated with information about a person, place, or thing. This static content is viewed by end users, but administrators can create or modify a custom object's configuration on the Business Objects screen. 

Use this screen to do the following:
- Create or modify a custom object.
- Modify or delete fields from custom objects.
- Customize labels and icons for fields.
- Update security for certain groups or user roles for custom objects.
- Export object definitions in a PDF or an Excel sheet.

To open this screen, click **Administration** > **Business Objects**.  
The Business Objects screen appears.  
![Object Definitions Screen](/assets/images/business-object-maintenance-screen.png "Object Definitions Screen")

To create a new object definition, click **Add**.  To modify an existing definition, select one from the grid and then click Modify.  
The Add or Modify Object Definition window appears.  
![Modify Object Definition Window](/assets/images/modify-object-definition-address.png "Modify Object Definition Window")

- The **Display Name** is the name that users will know the object by in the system. 
- The **Custom Search Placeholder** sets the text that will display in the top search bar on the search screen for the object.
- The **System Name** is just how the object is saved in the database.  When you first create the object, the system will automatically create a System Name based on the Display Name. 
- The **Id** is also automatically generated by the system and is just used to identify the object in the database.
- The **Has Notes & Activities** checkbox adds a tab to the object in the application where users can view related notes and documents.
- The **Top Level** checkbox adds the object to the left-hand menu to allow users to search for it in the system.

The rest of the screen is organized into tabs, which you can learn more about by clicking the links below.

- Use the **Fields** tab to [add and modify index fields](/docs/administrator-roles/application-admin/business-objects#adding-fields-to-a-custom-object) on the object.
- Default Security tab - Organizations and their subgroups appear. When an end-user adds an entry to the application using a custom object field, you can grant permissions to user groups so that the end-user can view, add, edit, or delete individual instances of custom object entries. Other organizations or users can be added in order to determine who has permissions to adjust these objects.
    
- Security by Type tab - The Type Field drop-down list appears so that you can [apply unique security settings for specific field types](/docs/administrator-roles/application-admin/business-objects#configuring-custom-object-security-settings).
    
- Use the **Disposition** tab to [configure record policies](/docs/records-management/create-a-record-policy) for the object
    
- The [Priority Search Fields](/docs/administrator-roles/priority-search-fields) tab lets you define which fields the system should use for the top search bar on custom object search screens as well as suggestions when users are typing in values for a custom object field.

## Preventing Duplicates of Field Values
To prevent duplicates of field values, customize the key fields in a custom object.

1. Click Administration > Custom Objects.  
    The Object Definitions screen appears.
    
2. Select an existing object and click Modify.  
    The Modify Object Definition window appears.  
    ![Modify Object Definition Window](/assets/images/modify-object-definition-address.png "Modify Object Definition Window")
    
3. Under the Fields tab, click Modify Key Fields.  
    The Manage Key Fields window appears.  
    ![Manage Key Fields Window](/assets/images/manage-key-fields-empty.jpeg "Manage Key Fields Window")
    
4. Click Add Group.  
    The Add Folder Fields window appears.
    
5. Select one field that you want the system to prevent a user from adding a duplicate of (ex. SSN).
    
6. Click Add.  
    The field appears in the Manage Key Fields window with Prevent Duplicates selected below it.  
    ![Manage Key Fields Window - One Field Added](/assets/images/Manage-key-fields-1result.jpeg "Manage Key Fields Window - One Field Added")
    
7. To add another separate field that cannot have duplicates, click Add Group, select another field, and click Add.
    
8. To stop the system from adding duplicates of a combination of fields, click Add Key Fields under an existing group.  
    The Add Folder Fields window appears.
    
9. Select another field, and click Add.  
    ![Manage Key Fields Window - Three Fields Added](/assets/images/Manage-key-fields-3results.png "Manage Key Fields Window - Three Fields Added")  
    The system prevents a user from adding duplicates of the combination of field values.
    
10. Click Save.  
    When users add information to the system using this custom object, the system prevents the user from adding a duplicate entry of a Create Date value, and duplicate entries of both SSN and Company values in combination.
    
{: .note}
If the fields Company and SSN are in the same Key Fields Group, and only one of the field values that a user enters matches a field value already in the system, then the system allows the user to add it. However, if the two values for the two fields have a matching combination of values already in the system, then the system does not allow the user to add a duplicate with these same values.

{: .note}
If a custom object has two Key Field Groups, then those values are separate from each other. If one of the values for a field has a matching value already in the system, then the system does not allow the user to add a duplicate with that same values.

## Modifying Labels for Custom Objects

Modifying a label helps identify search results faster. Labels correspond with how an item appears in search results.

1. Click **Administration** > **Custom Objects**.  
    The Object Definitions screen appears.
    
2. Select an existing object and click **Modify**.  
    The Modify Object Definition window appears.  
    ![Modify Object Definition Window](/assets/images/modify-object-definition-address.png "Modify Object Definition Window")
    
3. Under the Fields tab, click **Modify Label**.  
    The Modify [Custom Object Name] Label window appears.  
    ![Modify [Custom Object Name] Label Window](/assets/images/modify-label-window.png "Modify [Custom Object Name] Label Window")
    
4. In the Text Template field, field name placeholders appear (ex. {Address1}).
    
5. Click **Add Field**.  
    The Add Field to Label window appears with a drop-down list containing fields on the custom object.
    
6. From the drop-down list, select a field, and click **Add**.  
    The field name placeholder appears in the Text Template field in the Modify Label window.
    
7. You can also enter plain text to the field, such as punctuation to help format the label well.
    
8. Click **Save**.
    
9. In the Modify Object Definition window, click **Save**.  
    The label has been updated and saved for the custom object.
    
10. To see the label changes applied, perform a search for the custom object.

## Configuring Custom Object Security Settings
There are two ways to configure security settings for a custom object.

- The **Default Security** tab lets you set a default security configuration for the custom object.  This is likely what you will want to do for most custom objects.
- The **Security by Type** tab lets you set custom security configurations for the custom object depending on the value of a particular field on the custom object.  This can only be done for custom objects with a [List of Values](/docs/administrator-roles/application-admin/list-values-maintenance) field.

Follow the steps below to configure security on a custom object.

1. Click Administration > Custom Objects.  
    The Object Definitions screen appears.
    
2. Select an existing object and click Modify.  Note that to set security by type, the object must have a List of Values index field on it.  
    The Modify Object Definition window appears.  
    ![Modify Object Definition Window](/assets/images/modify-object-definition-address.png "Modify Object Definition Window")
    
3. To configure default security for the custom object, click the **Default Security** tab.  
    ![](/assets/images/modify-object-security-default.png)
    
4. Add new groups or users to the screen by clicking Add New ACL Entry.   
    This opens the _Select for Access Control List_ pop-up.  
    Locate the desired group or user and click **Select**.
    
5. Click on the relevant checkboxes to modify security settings for any groups or users on the screen, or click the **Remove Icon**(![](/assets/images/Icons/remove-icon-small.png)) next to any groups or users that do not need their own unique privileges on the custom object.
    
6. To set unique security on the object depending on the values of one of its index fields, click the Security by Type tab, and click the Type Field drop-down list.  
    Any index fields that are a List of Values appear in the drop-down list.
    
7. Select a list of value field.  
    Each value for the selected field has a Configure Security link.   
    ![](/assets/images/salutation.PNG)
    
8. Click Configure Security next to a list value.  
    The Configure Security window appears, which works just like the **Default Security** tab.
    
9. Make any desired modifications to the security, and click Save.  
    The security for that list value shows Customized.  
    You can always reset it to be the same as the security configured on the **Default Security** tab by clicking the new **Reset to Default** link that appears.
    
10. Once you are finiched modifying the security for the custom object, click Save.
