# Document Type Maintenance Screen
As a list of values, Document Type is an index field that has a limited number of values that an administrator set up. Unlike other index fields, when adding a document with a list of values index field, you must select an option from the existing document types offered and you cannot manually type the value.

Use this screen to do the following:
- Create document types.
- Use the created document types as searchable metadata when adding documents.
- Modify document type names.
- Print or export document type information as a PDF or an Excel sheet.
    

## Creating Document Types
The following task is an example scenario for using this screen.
1. Click Administration > Document Types.  
    The Document Type Maintenance screen appears.

2. Actions on this screen can be taken either by right-clicking on a given document type and selecting the desired action from a drop-down menu that appears, or left-clicking on a given document type and then clicking the desired button at the top of the screen.
    
3. Modify or Add a document type using either the right-click menu or the buttons at the top of the screen.  
    
4. In the Type field, enter the document type, and click Save.
    
5. You can also delete document types, as long as they are not in use. If you attempt to delete a document type that documents have already been added for, you will see an error message preventing you from deleting the document type.
