# Records Management Overview

Q-Action allows [Record Policies](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Creating_a_Record_Policy.htm) to be created by an Application Administrator.  These policies define conditions under which [Disposition Approval workflows](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Understanding_Disposition_Approval_Workflows.htm) will automatically kick off, which are used to authorize and implement disposition of records (e.g. Documents, Folders, or Custom Objects) in the system.

Users who are Records Managers can access a [Records Disposition Dashboard](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Records_Disposition_Dashboard.htm) which gives an overall view of Record Policies, the records they apply to, and the Disposition Workflows they have launched. Records Managers can also manage [Record Categories](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Record_Categories_vs_Record_Policies.htm), which are human-readable descriptions of the Record Policies in place.
