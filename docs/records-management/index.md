# Records Management Overview

QAction allows [Record Policies](/docs/records-management/create-a-record-policy) to be created by an Application Administrator.  These policies define conditions under which [Disposition Approval workflows](/docs/records-management/disposition-approval-workflow) will automatically kick off, which are used to authorize and implement disposition of records (e.g. Documents, Folders, or Custom Objects) in the system.

Users who are Records Managers can access a [Records Disposition Dashboard](/docs/records-management/records-disposition-dashboard) which gives an overall view of Record Policies, the records they apply to, and the Disposition Workflows they have launched. Records Managers can also manage [Record Categories](/docs/records-management/policies-categories), which are human-readable descriptions of the Record Policies in place.
