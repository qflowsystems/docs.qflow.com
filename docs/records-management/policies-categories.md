# Record Categories vs Record Policies

Record Categories and Record Policies are two sides of the same coin.  A Record Category defines and describes to users what the associated Record Policy does, whereas a Record Policy instructs the system on how to implement the associated Record Category.  Record Categories are managed by Records Managers, whereas Record Policies are managed by Application Administrators.

Application Administrators must create Record Policies using the Administration menu.  Learn more in Tutorial: [Create a Record Policy](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Creating_a_Record_Policy.htm).

Records managers will see a Record Category link in their left-hand menu.  This opens up the Search Record Category screen.  New Record Categories can be added simply by clicking the Add button (![](/assets/images/AddIconActive.png)) on the Search screen or the left-hand menu.
