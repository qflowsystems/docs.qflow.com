# Records Disposition Dashboard

This is a screen available to users who are Records Managers to view, track, and manage [Record Categories](/docs/records-management/policies-categories), the records that the associated [Record Policies](/docs/records-management/create-a-record-policy) apply to, and associated [Disposition Approval Workflows](/docs/records-management/disposition-approval-workflow).

To open the Records Disposition screen, first click on the Retention menu at the top of the screen.

An example Records Disposition screen is shown below.

Each item on this screen represents a Record Category.  Clicking on the blue title of the Category will open the Category for view/edit it much like on the Search Record Category screen.

Unlike the Search Record Category screen, the Records Disposition screen shows how many records the associated Policy applies to, and what the state of those records are:

- Total is the number of all records under the associated Policy.
- Cutoff Met is the number of records with Disposition Dates in the past.
- Cutoff Not Met is the number of records with Disposition Dates in the future.
- Holds is the number of records with a [Hold](/docs/records-management/record-holds) in place.
- Disposition Initiated is the number of records that have been included in an initiated Disposition Approval Workflow.

You can view Records in a given state by clicking on the number of records in that state.  This opens a Record search screen titled after the state you are viewing.

If there is a Disposition Approval Workflow for the Record Policy, there will be an Actions drop-down menu on the left side of the Record Category item.  Open that menu to view the Disposition Approval Workflow for the Policy.
