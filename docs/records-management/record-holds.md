# Placing Holds on Records

A record with a Hold is exempt from any Disposition Actions, even if its [Disposition Date](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Understanding_the_Disposition_Date.htm) is in the past.  The Hold on a record must be resolved before that record can finish going through the disposition process.

Holds can be placed on records either from the [Records Disposition Screen](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Records_Disposition_Dashboard.htm) or from within a [Disposition Approval Folder](https://qaprod.qflow.com/QAction_help//Understanding_Disposition_Approval_Workflows.htm).

On the Records Disposition Screen, click on the number next to Total on the policy relevant to the hold you want to place.

There may be no relevant records here, especially if several records under the policy already have Holds on them.  You can see in the screenshot above that there are 11 Held records for the Policy already.
