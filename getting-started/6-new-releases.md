# Step 6: New Releases
After a new release has been deployed, the What's New pop-up will show you a summary of some of the latest features of QAction. You can open the pop-up yourself by clicking the What's New? link in the top-right corner of the application.  The Contact Support link next to it opens a contact form so you can send questions or feedback to our support team.
