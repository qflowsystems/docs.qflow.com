# Step 4: Get Organized
You can customize your left-hand menu by clicking the **Organize** link at the bottom of the screen.  This reveals drop-down arrows next to each menu item.  

In the menu for top-level search links such as **Documents**, you can click **Create Group**, which adds a new label which you can drag and drop saved searches into to help keep them organized.  You can also create groups within other groups.  

If you mistakenly add something to a group, you can either drag it back out of the group, or use its drop-down menu to remove it from the group, which moves it outside of the group it's currently in. When you are finished organizing, simply click Done to return the menu to its normal appearance.
