# Step 1: Classifcations
By default, you see the Search Documents screen.

This screen starts with the **Classification** filter since it is an important filter for documents. A document's Classification is sort of like its location in Q-Action, and also defines things like security and what data gets associated with the document.

You can also add additional filters to your search using the **Filters** drop-down. Then click **Search** to see documents matching your criteria. You can change the size of the filters and results panels by clicking on and dragging the grey bar between them.
