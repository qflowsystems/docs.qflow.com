# Step 5: Update Your Profile
You can pick a different default start page in your **Profile** which you can open by clicking on your name in the top-right corner of the application.

You can change many other settings on this screen, too, such as the appearances of certain screens and how often the application notifies you about tasks.

Additionally, you can set up other users as **Proxies** which allows them to perform various actions on your behalf.  This is useful if for instance you will be out on vacation and need someone else to cover your work for that time.
