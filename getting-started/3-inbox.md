# Step 3: Your Inbox
A special link in the left-hand menu is the **Inbox**.

If your organization uses Workflows, the **Inbox** is where you will find tasks that are assigned to you or any groups that you are in.

The **Inbox** has three tabs, which are sort of like special saved searches. These tabs show you your active tasks, on hold tasks, and recently completed tasks.  You can also add search filters and create your own saved searches on this screen as shown in the previous slides.
